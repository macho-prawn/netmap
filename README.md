# netmap

`netmap` is a opinionated CLI built in G0 1.26 that resolves GCP projects from a local YAML inventory and maps either source dedicated interconnects or source VPN resources to their connected destination resources, Cloud Routers, interfaces, and BGP peers.

## Requirements

- Go `1.26.x` to build the binary
- Google Application Default Credentials available in the environment
- IAM permissions that allow listing interconnects, interconnect attachments, VPN gateways, VPN tunnels, routers, and router status

## Config

The CLI expects a YAML file with this structure:

```yaml
org:
  - name: dbc
    workload:
      - name: native
        env:
          - name: dev
            project_id: project
```

`project_id` is the destination project.

Selector expansion is:

```text
-o only: iterate all workloads and all environments under that org
-o and -w without -e: iterate all environments for that workload
-o and -e without -w: iterate all workloads containing that environment
-o, -w, and -e: resolve one exact workload/environment tuple
```

## Build

```bash
/usr/local/go/bin/go build ./cmd/netmap
```

## Version

```bash
./netmap version
./netmap
./netmap -h
```

```text
./netmap version prints the embedded CLI version, currently v2.0.0.
./netmap and ./netmap -h print the help menu without requiring ADC credentials.
All CLI parameter checks and config-file semantic validation complete before netmap initializes the Compute provider, checks ADC validity, or talks to the Compute API.
```

## Run Without Building

```bash
/usr/local/go/bin/go run ./cmd/netmap \
  -t interconnect \
  -o dbc \
  -w native \
  -e dev \
  -p src-project
```

If the default Go build cache location is not writable, run with an explicit cache path:

```bash
GOCACHE=/tmp/go-build-cache /usr/local/go/bin/go run ./cmd/netmap \
  -t interconnect \
  -o dbc \
  -w native \
  -e dev \
  -p src-project
```

## Test

```bash
/usr/local/go/bin/go test ./...
```

## Release

- `VERSION` is the release source of truth and currently contains `2.0.0`
- The release workflow prepends `v` when creating and checking release tags, so `VERSION=2.0.0` produces release tag `v2.0.0`
- The GitHub release title is also set to `v2.0.0`
- PR validation runs in workflow `NetMap Test` from `.github/workflows/netmap-test.yml`
- Release publishing runs in workflow `NetMap Release` from `.github/workflows/netmap-release.yml`
- The GitHub Actions job labels are:
  - `Code Test`
  - `Build and Release`
- Pull requests targeting `main` run `go test ./...` when changes land under `cmd/` or `internal/`
- Pull request checks are the only test gate; the release workflow does not re-run tests after merge
- The release workflow runs only after the pull request is merged into `main`
- The release workflow validates `VERSION` and fails in the build job if that version already exists
- Release artifacts are:
  - `netmap_<version>_darwin_amd64.tar.gz`
  - `netmap_<version>_windows_amd64.zip`
- Each archive contains only `README.md` and the platform binary
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains the shipped release history for versions such as `v2.0.0` and is used as the GitHub release notes source

## Usage

The usage text shown by `./netmap` and `./netmap -h` is sourced from the editable embedded file [internal/app/usage.txt](/home/macho_prawn/gh-repo/netmap/internal/app/usage.txt).

```bash
./netmap \
  -t interconnect \
  -o dbc \
  -w native \
  -e dev \
  -p src-project \
  -c config.yaml
```

### Flags

```text
-t  mandatory, accepts interconnect or vpn
-o  mandatory, org lookup key from the YAML config
-w  optional, workload selector; with -o and no -e, expands all environments in that workload
-e  optional, environment selector; with -o and no -w, expands all workloads containing that environment
-p  mandatory only for -t interconnect; source project containing dedicated interconnects
-f  optional, output format override: html, csv, tsv, json, or tree
-od optional, output directory for generated files; defaults to cwd
-c  optional, defaults to config.yaml
-h  optional, prints usage
```

## Behavior

### `-t interconnect`

- Lists dedicated interconnects in the source project.
- Fails if the source project has no dedicated interconnects.
- Lists destination VLAN attachments and Cloud Routers across regions.
- Maps router interfaces and BGP peers where available.
- Uses a shared hierarchy in JSON, tree, Mermaid, and HTML output rooted at `org -> workload -> environment -> src_project -> src_interconnect`.
- Uses one canonical field set across outputs, matching the CSV/TSV column names.
- Writes progress to stderr as an ASCII 2-column task table with one timed row per resolved org/workload/environment tuple, a Braille spinner on the active row, completed rows, and a merged final summary row.
- Validates CLI parameters and config selector semantics before initializing ADC-backed Compute discovery.
- Collapses identical environment, src_project, src_interconnect, and dst_region labels into shared Mermaid graph nodes.
- Uses Google Cloud Go libraries and ADC instead of shelling out to `gcloud`.

### `-t vpn`

- `-p` is rejected.
- Resolves selected config tuples as source projects.
- Lists source HA and Classic VPN gateways and connected VPN tunnels.
- Uses HA tunnel peer gateway references to discover destination GCP projects, VPN gateways, tunnels, and Cloud Routers.
- Includes Classic VPN gateways and tunnels as source-side unmapped output when no peer GCP project can be discovered.
- Uses a VPN-specific hierarchy across JSON, tree, Mermaid, and HTML output: `org -> workload -> environment -> src_project -> src_region -> src_vpn_gateway -> src_tunnel -> src_cloud_router -> bgp_peering_status -> dst_cloud_router -> dst_tunnel -> dst_vpn_gateway -> dst_region -> dst_project`.
- Uses a VPN-specific Mermaid grouping strategy that shares repeated `src_project -> src_region[src_vpc]` nodes and collapses identical destination gateway/region/project paths within the same source-tunnel branch.
- Uses the same csv, tsv, json, tree, mermaid, and html output formats as interconnect reports.

## Output

| Case | Interconnect | VPN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default output with omitted `-f` | `netmap-interconnect-<src>-to-<dst>-<timestamp>.mmd` | `netmap-vpn-<org>-<selector>-<timestamp>.mmd` |
| Explicit format extensions | `html`, `csv`, `tsv`, `json`, `tree.txt` on the `netmap-interconnect-<src>-to-<dst>-<timestamp>` base | `html`, `csv`, `tsv`, `json`, `tree.txt` on the `netmap-vpn-<org>-<selector>-<timestamp>` base |
| Aggregate output | `netmap-interconnect-<src>-to-<org>-all-<timestamp>.<ext>` | `netmap-vpn-<org>-all-<timestamp>.<ext>` |
| Selector naming | n/a | `-o/-w/-e`: `<workload>-<env>`; `-o` only: `all`; `-o/-w`: `<workload>-all`; `-o/-e`: `all-<env>` |

`-f html` writes a self-contained offline Mermaid viewer page that can be opened directly in a browser.

Generated files are written to the current working directory by default, or under the directory provided with `-od`.

Structured `json`, `tree`, `mermaid`, and `html` outputs use branch-scoped unprefixed field names in visible labels and JSON leaf keys. Flat `csv` and `tsv` outputs remain canonical and keep `src_` / `dst_` prefixes.

On success, the CLI prints a merged final summary row containing:

```text
Output: <path>
Total Time: <duration>
```

Use that path directly when opening or sharing the generated file.

### CSV/TSV columns

#### Interconnect

```text
org,workload,environment,src_project,src_interconnect,mapped,src_region,src_state,src_macsec_enabled,src_macsec_keyname,dst_project,dst_region,dst_vpc,dst_vlan_attachment,dst_vlan_attachment_state,dst_vlan_attachment_vlanid,dst_cloud_router,dst_cloud_router_asn,dst_cloud_router_interface,dst_cloud_router_interface_ip,remote_bgp_peer,remote_bgp_peer_ip,remote_bgp_peer_asn,bgp_peering_status
```

#### VPN

```text
org,workload,environment,src_project,src_region,src_vpn_gateway,src_vpn_gateway_type,src_cloud_router,src_cloud_router_asn,src_cloud_router_interface,src_cloud_router_interface_ip,src_vpn_tunnel,src_vpn_gateway_interface,src_vpn_gateway_ip,src_vpn_tunnel_status,bgp_peering_status,dst_vpn_tunnel,dst_vpn_gateway_interface,dst_vpn_gateway_ip,dst_vpn_tunnel_status,dst_cloud_router,dst_cloud_router_asn,dst_cloud_router_interface,dst_cloud_router_interface_ip,dst_vpn_gateway,dst_vpn_gateway_type,dst_region,dst_project
```

## Notes

- Source dedicated interconnects are modeled as global resources
- Source dedicated interconnect MACsec status and key name are emitted in the canonical source field block when available
- Destination VLAN attachments and Cloud Routers are modeled as regional resources
- Destination VPC is derived from the destination VLAN attachment network and emitted as `dst_vpc` in flat output and `vpc` in structured output
- Destination Cloud Router ASN is emitted in the canonical destination router field block when available
- Remote BGP peer ASN is emitted only in interconnect output
- Unmapped source interconnects are still included in the output
- Unmapped source Classic VPN gateways and tunnels are also included in the output when peer GCP project discovery is unavailable
- Mermaid output is a shared-node DAG and may intentionally collapse matching labels across workload, environment, source-project, interconnect, and destination-region layers
- VPN Mermaid output uses a separate node-key strategy that collapses repeated `src_project -> src_region[src_vpc]` pairs and reuses identical destination gateway/region/project nodes within the same source-tunnel branch
- In structured VPN output, source and destination region nodes render as `region [vpc: ...]`
- VPN Mermaid renders `bgp_peering_status` as its own node between source and destination `cloud_router` nodes
- Mermaid labels use `<br>` line breaks so they render correctly in Mermaid-compatible viewers, including the offline HTML output
- Runtime discovery is performed with Google Compute API clients, not the `gcloud` CLI
